## Supervised Finetuning

    Step by Step (Supervised Fine tuning)

    Pre-steps

    #1) Extract the training.zip (that has 7 existing leaftaps example)
    #2) Extract leaftaps.zip (Selenium Java framework with TrainingDataConverter)
    #3) Import project as maven project in eclipse / vscode 

    Steps

    1.⁠ ⁠Data Collection

    •⁠  ⁠As a team, go to leaftaps application ( Credentials for leaftaps: demosalesmanager ./ crmsfa)
    •⁠  ⁠Collect DOM (app) and equivalent page (leaftaps POM Project)
    •⁠  ⁠Store in the existing format ===HTML=== ... ===JAVA===
    •⁠  ⁠Save it as <page_name.txt>
    •⁠  ⁠Once you complete other 3-4 missing txt 

    2) Generate jsonl

    •⁠  ⁠Go to the Maven Java project (leaftaps)
    •⁠  ⁠Go to the TrainingDataConverter class
    •⁠  ⁠Change the file path (line 58,59)
    •⁠  ⁠Save and Run as Java applicaton
    •⁠  ⁠The jsonl should get generated and verify
    •⁠  ⁠Confirm it has 10 or more !!

    3) Upload training data

    •⁠  ⁠Go to api.testleaf.com, login
    •⁠  ⁠Model --> Storage
    •⁠  ⁠Click Upload, drag-drop the file, choose fine-tune
    •⁠  ⁠Click Upload button and you will see file id (note id for reference file-FEbcWaTdHos1JmkRJcHb9y )


    4) Create Fine tuning model

    •⁠  ⁠Fine tuning --> Create
    •⁠  ⁠Select Supervised Fine tuning, Base Model (4o-mini)
    •⁠  ⁠Select the existing training data (that you upoaded in step 3)
    •⁠  ⁠Select Batch size (1)
    •⁠  ⁠Select LR Multiplier (0.05 to 0.1)
    •⁠  ⁠Select Epochs (4-5)
    •⁠  ⁠Click Create Model

    5) Monitor the fine tuning model

    •⁠  ⁠Watch the Messages for errors
    •⁠  ⁠If there are errors, debug
    •⁠  ⁠Watch 'Fine-tuning job started' message
    •⁠  ⁠Note the training loss and other fields
    •⁠  ⁠It may take 10 minutes for the job to complete
    •⁠  ⁠Once successful, copy the output model
    (Example: ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:internals::CHhwqIBG)

    6.⁠ ⁠Create API Key

    •⁠  ⁠Create new API key for api.testleaf.com 
    •⁠  ⁠Note it down

    7.⁠ ⁠Change the model and prompt (ai-extension)

    •⁠  ⁠popup.js (add the following details in 118 or so)

        ,
        testleaf: [
            { value: 'ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:internals::CHhwqIBG', label: 'Leaftaps SFT' }
        ]
    •⁠  ⁠replace the ft model with yours and make label meaningful

    •⁠  ⁠Open the prompts.js and go to SELENIUM_JAVA_PAGE_ONLY
    •⁠  ⁠Update the instructions (use fine tuned model)
    •⁠  ⁠Update the example (with LoginPage.java that uses your framework)
    •⁠  ⁠Save the file

    8.⁠ ⁠Validate the extension

    •⁠  ⁠Close the existing extension (Do not have remove)
    •⁠  ⁠Open it again
    •⁠  ⁠Go to settings, choose testleaf, model
    •⁠  ⁠Update the testleaf api key
    •⁠  ⁠close the extension and reopen
    •⁠  ⁠choose page class and inspect few elements of leaftaps app
    •⁠  ⁠Validate the output of the generated code
    •⁠  ⁠It should be in the framework format

    Notes:

    •⁠  ⁠Sometimes, the cached tokens - you will see the code generating in old format
    •⁠  ⁠After few generations, you will notice is all fine 
    •⁠  ⁠Take away: Try to generate few page classes, before you come to conclusion
